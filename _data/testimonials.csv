"I attended Abbey Physio because I was falling a lot at home. Maura O’Dea helped me regain my confidence and with her advice and treatment, my balance has returned. I know how to be careful and I do the exercises every day, twice some days! Maura has been very encouraging and the physiotherapy has made such a difference. I still attend as I want to keep improving.",
"Sean McAuliffe assessed me and treated me for a long-standing hip and knee problem. I had been told I would need surgery, but now my surgeon says I have improved so much that I don’t need it, as I’ve strengthened up so well. The pain has eased a lot, some days it’s gone completely, and I’m back walking my dog. Life is much better and I feel stronger and fitter now, thanks to Sean.",
"I was off work for over 2 years with back pain, as I was injured at work. The Company Doctor sent me to Abbey Physio for a rehabilitation programme to see if I could get back to work. I was very depressed and had lost hope. Annette Shanahan assessed me and I started a return to work rehabilitation programme. She supported me and I made a successful and full return to work. I’m back to myself again. Thanks to Annette for her expertise and care.",
